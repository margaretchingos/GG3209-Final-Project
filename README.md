This Repository contains my GG3209 Final Project: Comparison of Solar and Wind Suitability in Kech, Pakistan

**Abstract:** Acknowledging Pakistanâ€™s energy crisis and need for renewable energy sources, this project compares the potential for wind and solar development in Kech, Pakistan. Using MCE in QGIS and data analysis in Python, it finds that 42.66% of Kech is 'most suitable' for solar, and 11.57% is 'most suitable' for wind. It concludes that Kech has more opportunities for solar development. This data is displayed spatially in suitability maps and quantitatively in a bar chart.
